      <h2><b>Our Company</b></h2>
        <p>In 1968, Joseph Manning, Sr. began working as an independent plumber out of his garage. His goal was simple: to provide quality, dependable, and affordable plumbing and heating services to residential customers. If he did that, he knew his business would grow.</p>
        <p>Today, Joe Manning, Jr. is still committed to the same level of service and quality that made his father a household name in the Albuquerque area. Along with our general plumbing services, we install and maintain heating and   cooling systems, including our solar thermal systems, and we offer residential and commercial maintenance management services.</p>
